# BeatBot
##Things to work on:
- Check if logged in, if logged in take to user profile, if not logged in take them to /login (or keep on index, but display login/create an account box)
- When a user is on their profile they should see their playlist names (songs in playlist, will be in a collapsed div that can expand)
- Search box can change between song, album or artist
- API's to add: Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, iTunes, LastFM, etc.. (choose 3?)
- Setting up routes, gets, posts, handlebars (layouts w/ dynamic code)
- Any public files can go in the public folder
- Add a view for public vs private users (if user says public, than anyone can type in users name and see playlists, but not edit, etc..)
